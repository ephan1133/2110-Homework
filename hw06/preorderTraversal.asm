;;  Name:
;;============================================================

;;  In this file, you must implement the 'PREORDER_TRAVERSAL' subroutine.

;;  Little reminder from your friendly neighborhood 2110 TA staff: don't run
;;  this directly by pressing 'Run' in complx, since there is nothing put at
;;  address x3000. Instead, call the subroutine by doing the following steps:
;;      * 'Debug' -> 'Simulate Subroutine Call'
;;      * Call the subroutine at the 'PREORDER_TRAVERSAL' label
;;      * Add the [root (addr), arr (addr), index] params separated by a comma (,) 
;;        (e.g. x4000, x4020, 0)
;;      * Proceed to run, step, add breakpoints, etc.
;;      * Remember R6 should point at the return value after a subroutine
;;        returns. So if you run the program and then go to 
;;        'View' -> 'Goto Address' -> 'R6 Value', you should find your result
;;        from the subroutine there (e.g. Node 8 is found at x4008)

;;  If you would like to setup a replay string (trace an autograder error),
;;  go to 'Test' -> 'Setup Replay String' -> paste the string (everything
;;  between the apostrophes (')) excluding the initial " b' ". If you are 
;;  using the Docker container, you may need to use the clipboard (found
;;  on the left panel) first to transfer your local copied string over.

;;  PREORDER_TRAVERSAL Pseudocode (see PDF for explanation and examples)
;;  - Nodes are blocks of size 3 in memory:
;;      * The data is located in the 1st memory location (offset 0 from the node itself)
;;      * The node's left child address is located in the 2nd memory location (offset 1 from the node itself)
;;      * The node's right child address is located in the 3rd memory location (offset 2 from the node itself)

;;  PREORDER_TRAVERSAL(Node root (addr), int[] arr (addr), int index) {
;;      if (root == 0) {
;;          return index;
;;      }
;;
;;      arr[index] = root.data;
;;      index++;
;;
;;      index = PREORDER_TRAVERSAL(root.left, arr, index);
;;      return PREORDER_TRAVERSAL(root.right, arr, index);
;;  }
