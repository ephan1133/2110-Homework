;;  In this file, you must implement the 'MULTIPLY' and 'FACTORIAL' subroutines.

;;  Little reminder from your friendly neighborhood 2110 TA staff: don't run
;;  this directly by pressing 'Run' in complx, since there is nothing put at
;;  address x3000. Instead, call the subroutine by doing the following steps:
;;      * 'Debug' -> 'Simulate Subroutine Call'
;;      * Call the subroutine at the 'MULTIPLY' or 'FACTORIAL' labels
;;      * Add the [a, b] or [n] params separated by a comma (,) 
;;        (e.g. 3, 5 for 'MULTIPLY' or 6 for 'FACTORIAL')
;;      * Proceed to run, step, add breakpoints, etc.
;;      * Remember R6 should point at the return value after a subroutine
;;        returns. So if you run the program and then go to 
;;        'View' -> 'Goto Address' -> 'R6 Value', you should find your result
;;        from the subroutine there (e.g. 3 * 5 = 15 or 6! = 720)

;;  If you would like to setup a replay string (trace an autograder error),
;;  go to 'Test' -> 'Setup Replay String' -> paste the string (everything
;;  between the apostrophes (')) excluding the initial " b' ". If you are 
;;  using the Docker container, you may need to use the clipboard (found
;;  on the left panel) first to transfer your local copied string over.
